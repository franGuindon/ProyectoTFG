Unfortunately, it is particularly hard to model due to its unpredictable nature and content-dependency. We propose a human perception based no-reference framework utilizing motion-compensated frame interpolation and colour gradients to identify and localize packet loss impaired regions in video frames. The unique and principal contribution of this work is the attempt to mimic the human visual system throughout the process instead of the traditional approach of trying to replicate the mean opinion score.",

An alternative method using a single table of values representing the integral over the texture function rather than the function itself may yield superior results at similar cost. The necessary algorithms to support the new technique are explained. Finally, the cost and performance of the new technique is compared to previous techniques.},

The new software proves to scale best with the number of features, samples, trees, and features tried for splitting.

abstract = {An error matrix is frequently employed to organize and display information used to assess the thematic accuracy of a land-cover map, and numerous accuracy measures have been proposed for summarizing the information contained in this error matrix. No one measure is universally best for all accuracy assessment objectives, and different accuracy measures may lead to conflicting conclusions because the measures do not represent accuracy in the same tray. Choosing appropriate accuracy measures that address objectives of the mapping project is critical. Characteristics of some commonly used accuracy measures are described, and relationships among these measures are provided to aid the user in choosing an appropriate measure. Accuracy measures that are directly interpretable as probabilities of encountering certain types of misclassification errors or correct classifications should be selected in. preference to measures not interpretable as such. User's and producer's accuracy and the overall proportion OF area correctly classified are examples of accuracy measures possessing the desired probabilistic interpretation. The kappa coefficient of agreement does not possess such a probabilistic interpretation because of the adjustment for hypothetical chance agreement incorporated into this measure, and the strong dependence of kappa on the marginal proportions of the error matrix makes the utility of kappa for comparisons suspect. Normalizing an error matrix results in estimates that are not consistent for accuracy paramteters of the map being assessed, so that this procedure is generally not warranted for most applications.}

This paper presents three results for fusion: (1) a new algorithm for fusing a collection of parallel and sequential loops, minimizing parallel loop synchronization while maximizing parallelism; (2) a proof that performing fusion to maximize data locality is NP-hard; and (3) two polynomial-time algorithms for improving data locality. These techniques also apply to loop distribution, which is shown to be essentially equivalent to loop fusion. Our approach is general enough to support other fusion heuristics. Preliminary experimental results validate our approach for improving performance by exploiting data locality and increasing the granularity of parallelism.",

    abstract =  {This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol. RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services. RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services. The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers. The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes. There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},

  abstract = {Analyzing data sets of billions of records has now become a regular task in many companies and institutions. In the statistical analysis of those massive data sets, sampling generally plays a very important role. In this work, we describe a scalable simple random sampling algorithm, named ScaSRS, which uses probabilistic thresholds to decide on the fly whether to accept, reject, or wait-list an item independently of others. We prove, with high probability, it succeeds and needs only O(√k) storage, where k is the sample size. ScaSRS extends naturally to a scalable stratified sampling algorithm, which is favorable for heterogeneous data sets. The proposed algorithms, when implemented in MapReduce, can effectively reduce the size of intermediate output and greatly improve load balancing. Empirical evaluation on large-scale data sets clearly demonstrates their superiority.},
